**verless** (pronounced like _serverless_) is a Static Site Generator designed for Markdown-based content with focus on
simplicity and performance. It reads your Markdown files, applies your HTML templates and renders them as a website.

## <img src="https://verless.dominikbraun.io/assets/img/dot.png"> Features

* Flexibility: Provide and use your default template for all pages, or use a different template for a specific page
* Simplicity: Build your entire website within a single CLI command
* Performance: Generating your website only takes a few seconds, even for thousands of pages
* Rapid Development: Get started quickly with verless' small and reduced feature set
* Configurability: Provide additional information or override defaults in `verless.yml`
* Portability: verless is packaged as a single binary without any dependencies for multiple platforms

## <img src="https://verless.dominikbraun.io/assets/img/dot.png"> Examples

* Example project structure: [verless/example](https://github.com/verless/example)
* Real-world example website: [dominikbraun.io](https://dominikbraun.io)

### Linux and macOS

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/verless/verless/releases) for your platform. Extract the
downloaded binary into a directory like `/usr/local/bin`. Make sure the directory is in `PATH`.

### Windows

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/verless/verless/releases), create a directory like
`C:\Program Files\verless` and extract the executable into that directory.
[Add the directory to `Path`](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm).

### Docker

Assuming your project directory is `my-blog`, the following command builds your website:

```shell script
$ docker container run -v $(pwd)/my-blog:/project verless/verless
```

The container will build the project mounted at `/project` and you'll find the website in `my-blog/target`. To run
another command, just append it to the image name:

```shell script
$ docker container run verless/verless version
```

## <img src="https://verless.dominikbraun.io/assets/img/dot.png"> Getting started

If you are ready to get your hands dirty and test if everything works as expected, you may want to start with a quick
example. Create a project directory on your local machine, e.g. `coffee-blog`, and a file called `verless.yml` inside of
it:

```yaml
# File: coffee-blog/verless.yml
site:
  meta:
    title: Coffee Blog
    subtitle: About Espresso & Cappuccino
```

This file stores global metadata for your website and offers the possibility to modify your website manually, for
example you could override the generated navigation items here.

After that, create a directory `templates/` inside your project and add a template file called `index-page.html`:

```html
<!-- File: coffee-blog/templates/index-page.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>{{.Meta.Title}}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>{{.Meta.Title}}</h1>
        <h3>{{.Meta.Subtitle}}</h3>
    </body>
</html>
```

Now run the following command inside your project directory:

```shell script
$ verless build
```

The generated website is in the created `target` directory. You're now good to
[create your first content](https://github.com/verless/verless/tree/master/docs)!
