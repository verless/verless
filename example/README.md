# Welcome to the example project

This small example project demonstrates how a verless website could look like. It contains the basic templates, some
content files, some images and a stylesheet. Feel free to check out how Markdown files are structured or how certain
page fields are accessed in templates. For more in-depth explanations, check out the
[documentation](https://github.com/verless/verless/tree/master/docs).

## Building the example project

If you've [installed verless](https://github.com/verless/verless#-installation), building the example project on your
own is fairly simple.

```shell script
$ git clone https://github.com/verless/verless
$ cd verless
$ verless build example
```

The generated website will be stored in `example/target`.
